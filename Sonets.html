						<h2>Sonet 31</h2>
						<p>
							Every morning I called for walkes in a forest,<br>
							Every single day I called for peace and rest.<br>
							Every morning I want to wake up next to you,<br>
							Every single day I want to spend only with you.<br>
							Eyes like a doe deep, dark, beatiful, full of pain,<br>
							Before I met you my life was like a november rain.<br>
							When magical glow spread around,<br>
							I heard a long, soft sound.<br>
							Really authoritativ, strict but still kind,<br>
							If I missed you, I would be blinder than blind.<br>
							Mind pure, faithful, honest, sensitive,<br>
							Only you are my love narrative.<br><br>
							Every morning I call for merciful death,<br>
							But for you I can’t take away my breath.

						<h2>Sonet 32</h2>
						<p>
							Every single night I fight demons,<br> 
							Every midnight I get a nightmares,<br>
							Every single night I dream about you,<br>
							Every midnight I need to be with you.<br>
							Eyes dark, beautiful and full of pain, <br>
							In your pure, light mind is only rain.<br>
							Soul like an angel sensitive, pure,<br>
							You are giving to me my life cure.<br>
							In you I found my Heaven in Hell,<br>
							I hope you will find in me as well.<br>
							Every night I fight demons, nightmares,<br>
							Get them out can only your presence.<br><br>
							I love you, change my mind,<br>
							You know, you aren´t blind.

							What all the broken hearts?<br>
							What all the thoughts?<br>
							What all the reasons?<br>
							What all the things?<br>
							What all the minds?<br>
							What all the rights?<br>
							Everyone have one broken heart.<br>
							Only I know when I have right.<br>
							No feelings, just knowledge.<br>
							Only one mind exist, yours.<br>
							Reason? My way of life.<br>
							None of things matters.<br><br>
							Only one human is your reason.<br>
							Only, only you are your reason.<br>
